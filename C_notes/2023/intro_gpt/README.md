# C_notes

Initial C language curriculum provided by the following prompt from ChatGPT

I am an non-beginner python programmer that has an electrical engineering background and has experience with firmware and Linux. I am not an advanced or intermediate programmer, but i am not a beginner. I have minimal experience with embedded C programming and I want to get deep into learning C from both the top-down high level programming perspective, and the bottom-up electrical engineering perspective. 
Make me a curriculum in the form of common problem sets that are simple C projects that can take me from zero C language experience to easy-leetcode level questions. Just easy enough that i can get used to the syntax again, but difficult enough for me to problem-solve my way to the solution.
