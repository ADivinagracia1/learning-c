 # C notebook in Github

Welcome to where I keep random notes about the C and C++ programming language. I once learned C++ at some point in my life. Now, I need to start from the basics again and work my way from there. I am pretty excited to get into this again to be honest, and I want to seriously try to refresh myself. No skipping steps

I typically have a scrap ringed notebook from Muji as where I write my notes. However, seeing this as a digital list changes that. These notes are the ones I will reference whenever I need anything C-related. I come from the background of electrical, and I want to tailor my experience particulary towards embedded systems. I am comfortable enough in this environment to use the tools within my disposal, but I want to be proficient. This notebook is the journey where I become proficient. I want to be a wizzard, where my tomes and spells are not perfomed through runes and glyphs, they are instead cast through electricty and programs. As tradution with all my notebooks, I write the passage of Miyamoto Musashi. Dokkodo - the way of walking alone. Its supersticous, but I find it a way to make my experience a little more fun.

## Dokkodo - Miyamoto Musashi's Way of Walking Alone
1. Accept Everything just the way it is // Do not oppose the ways of the world
2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake
3. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling
4. Think lightly of yourself, and think deeply of the world
5. Be detached from desire your whole life long
6. Do not regret what you have done
7. Never be jealous
8. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation
9. Resentment and complaint are inapproprate for oneself and others
10. DO not let yourself be guided by the feeling of love or lust
11. In all things have no preferences
12. Be indifferent to where you live
13. Do not persue the taste of good food
14. Do not hold on to posessions you no longer need 
15. DO not act following customary belifs
16. Do not collect or practice with weapons beyond what is useful
17. Do not fear death
18. Do not seek to posses either goods or fiefs for your old age
19. Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help
20. You may abandon your body but you must preserve your honor
21. Never stray from the Way

My way always came from exploration and expression. I played a lot of videogames when i was younger, I became a damn good engineer at one point, and now at this point in time, I am a pretty gnarly rock climber. Lets rewind back my way and redirect that energy towards engineering again. I hope this works!
